      summary: Upload file to Walrus (Hybrid Encryption Mode)
      description: |
        **Purpose**: Upload financial documents to Walrus decentralized storage with flexible encryption

        **Why Upload Relay is Needed**:
        - Direct browser uploads to Walrus require ~2000+ HTTP requests per file
        - This creates significant browser performance issues and potential failures
        - Upload relay reduces this to a single API call from frontend
        - Backend handles the heavy lifting using @mysten/walrus SDK

        **Encryption Modes** (controlled by `mode` query parameter):

        **Mode A: client_encrypted (Default, Recommended)**
        - File is encrypted by frontend using @mysten/seal SDK before upload
        - To perform client-side encryption, the frontend must first fetch the deal's access control policy from the `GET /deals/{dealId}/seal-policy` endpoint.
        - Backend only relays the ciphertext to Walrus (never sees plaintext)
        - Highest security: Backend cannot access file contents
        - Fully Web3: User controls their own data encryption

        Upload Flow:
        1. Frontend: User selects file → Fetches Seal Policy → Encrypts with Seal SDK → Sends ciphertext
        2. Backend: Receives ciphertext → Uploads to Walrus → Returns blobId
        3. Frontend: Signs Sui transaction to register blob on-chain

        **Mode B: server_encrypted (Convenience Mode)**
        - Frontend sends plaintext file to backend
        - Backend encrypts using Seal SDK, then uploads to Walrus
        - Simplified upload: Frontend doesn't need Seal SDK for encryption
        - Trade-off: Backend can access plaintext during upload (trusted environment required)
        - Download: Frontend still decrypts using Seal SDK (maintains security)

        Upload Flow:
        1. Frontend: User selects file → Sends plaintext to backend
        2. Backend: Encrypts with Seal → Uploads to Walrus → Returns blobId
        3. Frontend: Signs Sui transaction to register blob on-chain

        **Walrus Integration**:
        - SDK: Uses @mysten/walrus TypeScript SDK
        - Network: Uploads to configured Walrus aggregator/publisher
        - Storage: Stores ONLY encrypted ciphertext (never plaintext)
        - Metadata: Returns blobId and commitment for on-chain registration

        **Seal Integration**:
        - Policy: `earnout_seal_policy` controls who can decrypt. The policy is retrieved via the `GET /deals/{dealId}/seal-policy` endpoint.
        - Access: Only buyer/seller/auditor can decrypt based on on-chain roles
        - Decryption keys: Managed by Seal Key Servers with blockchain verification

        **Next Steps After Upload**:
        - Frontend must call a Sui transaction to register this blobId on-chain
        - Transaction binds blob to specific deal/period
        - This creates immutable audit trail of data submissions

        **Access Control**:
        - Role: Authenticated users (primarily buyer uploading data)
        - Verification: User must be a participant in the specified deal

      summary: Download encrypted file from Walrus (Frontend Decryption)
      description: |
        **Purpose**: Download encrypted financial documents from Walrus for frontend decryption

        **Download Flow**:
        1. Frontend: Requests blobId with user's Sui address
        2. Backend: Verifies access → Downloads ciphertext from Walrus → Returns ciphertext
        3. Frontend: Uses `@mysten/seal` SDK to decrypt locally

        **Encryption Transparency**:
        - The response header `X-Original-Encryption-Mode` indicates how the file was encrypted during upload:
          - `client_encrypted`: Frontend encrypted the file before upload
          - `server_encrypted`: Backend encrypted the file during upload
        - Regardless of upload method, **frontend always decrypts** using Seal SDK

        **Seal Policy Information**:
        - Backend provides `X-Seal-Package-Id` and `X-Seal-Whitelist-Id` headers
        - Frontend uses these to request decryption keys from Seal Key Servers
        - Access control is enforced by the whitelist Move contract on Sui blockchain

        **Access Control**:
        - Verification: User must be buyer/seller/auditor in the specified deal
        - On-chain check: Backend queries Sui blockchain to verify user's role via whitelist
        - Only authorized users can decrypt the data

        **Security Features**:
        - Backend never decrypts or sees plaintext during download
        - All access attempts are logged for audit trail
        - Invalid access attempts return 403 Forbidden
        - Decryption keys are fetched on-demand from Seal Key Servers (not stored)
