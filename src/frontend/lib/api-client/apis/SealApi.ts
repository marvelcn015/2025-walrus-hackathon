/**
 * M&A Earn-out API
 * # M&A Earn-out Management API  This API powers a decentralized M&A earn-out tracking and settlement system built on **Sui blockchain**, **Walrus decentralized storage**, and **Seal encryption**.  ## System Overview  The system enables buyers (acquirers), sellers, and auditors to: - Create and manage earn-out agreements on-chain - Store encrypted financial documents on Walrus - Track KPIs and verify calculations transparently - Execute settlements automatically based on audited KPIs  ## Technology Stack  - **Blockchain**: Sui Network (smart contracts in Move) - **Storage**: Walrus (decentralized file storage) - **Encryption**: Seal (role-based access control) - **Frontend**: Next.js with @mysten/dapp-kit  ## Key Concepts  ### Deal An on-chain earn-out agreement with defined periods, KPI types, and payout formulas. Each deal has three roles: - **Buyer**: Creates deal, uploads data, proposes KPIs, executes settlements - **Seller**: Monitors progress, receives payouts - **Auditor**: Verifies data, attests KPIs  ### Period A time range (e.g., fiscal year) with specific KPI targets and earn-out formulas. Each period progresses through stages: 1. Data Collection (buyer uploads financial documents) 2. KPI Proposal (buyer proposes calculated KPI) 3. KPI Attestation (auditor verifies and approves) 4. Settlement (buyer executes payout to seller)  ### Walrus Blobs Encrypted financial documents stored on Walrus network. Access controlled by Seal policy on Sui blockchain.  ### KPI (Key Performance Indicator) Metrics like revenue, EBITDA, or custom metrics that determine earn-out amounts according to on-chain formulas.  ## Authentication  This API uses **Sui wallet signature-based authentication**. Every request must include: - `X-Sui-Address`: User\'s Sui wallet address - `X-Sui-Signature`: Base64-encoded signature of the timestamp message - `X-Sui-Signature-Message`: ISO timestamp that was signed (e.g., \"2025-11-20T10:30:45.123Z\")  Signatures expire after **5 minutes** to prevent replay attacks. Role-based access control is enforced on-chain via Sui smart contracts.  ## Workflow  1. **Setup**: Buyer creates deal and sets earn-out parameters 2. **Data Upload**: Buyer uploads encrypted financial docs to Walrus (via upload relay) 3. **KPI Proposal**: After period ends, buyer proposes KPI value 4. **Verification**: Auditor decrypts docs, verifies calculations, attests KPI 5. **Settlement**: Buyer executes settlement, funds transferred to seller  ## API Organization  - **Deal Management**: Create and manage earn-out deals - **Parameters**: Configure earn-out formulas and periods - **Walrus**: Upload relay for encrypted file storage - **Timeline**: View data submission history - **KPI Management**: Propose and attest KPIs - **Settlement**: Execute earn-out payments - **Dashboard**: Aggregated view of deal status
